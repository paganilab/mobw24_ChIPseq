    "text": "Tips for designing a ChIP-seq experiment\nBesides characterizing binding patterns in general, a common goal in ChIP-seq experiments is to identify changes in protein binding patterns between conditions, an application known as differential binding.\nEffective analysis of ChIP-seq data requires sufficient coverage by sequence reads (sequencing depth). It mainly depends on the size of the genome, and the number and size of the binding sites of the protein.\n\nFor mammalian (or any species with a relatively large genome) transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin modifications such as enhancer-associated histone marks: 20 million reads are adequate\nProteins with more binding sites (e.g., RNA Pol II) or more promiscuous factors (e.g.¬†CTCF) need more reads, up to 60 million for mammalian ChIP-seq\nSequencing depth rules of thumb: &gt;10M reads for narrow peaks, &gt;20M for broad peaks (you will understand better this concept later in the Peak Calling section)\nLong & paired-end reads are useful, but not essential - they may however help in specific, high-precision binding site discovery\nReplicates: Unlike with RNA-Seq, more than two replicates do not significantly increase the number of identified peaks\n\nA successful ChIP-seq experiment must have the appropriate controls to optimize signal-noise ratio. Well-made controls help eliminate false positives. In fact, there is always some signal on open chromatin. This may be due to multiple factors, but can be boiled down to three reasons: A) non-specific binding from the antibody can precipitate random sequences B) digestion, sonication, or any other method of shearing will introduce biases towards certain sequences C) different operators will perform the same protocol slightly differently, yielding higher or lower signal/noise ratios. The following controls are often used to abate these biases:\n\nAn ‚Äúinput‚Äù DNA sample in which a library is generated from DNA that has been cross-linked and sonicated but not immuno-precipitated. It controls for the bias introduced before even immunoprecipitating, i.e.¬†from sonication.\nAn IgG ‚Äúmock‚Äù-ChIP, using an antibody that will not bind to nuclear proteins and should generate random immuno-precipitated DNA. It controls for non-specific sequences that precipitate alongside the target protein, but are not bound by it.\nA Spike-In can also be introduced, using different genomes (e.g.¬†Drosophila in a Human experiment) to control for handling variability between users, or batch differences between reagents. This helps dampen these confounders.\n\n\nInput DNA control is ideal in most of the cases. Indeed, one problem with IgG control is that if too little DNA is recovered after immuno-precipitation, sequencing library will be of low complexity and binding sites identified using this control could be biased.

    "text": "R fundamentals\n\nBasic computations\nThe most basic computation you can do in R is arithmetic operations. Let‚Äôs take a look at the following examples:\n\n# Addition\n14 + 7\n\n[1] 21\n\n# Division\n14 / 7\n\n[1] 2\n\n# Square root\nsqrt(14)\n\n[1] 3.741657\n\n\nBut R is much more than an enormous calculator! Besides arithmetic operations, there are also logical queries you can perform. Logical queries always return either the value TRUE or FALSE.\n\n#1 Is it TRUE or FALSE?\n3 == 3\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n#2 Is 45 bigger than 55?\n50 &gt; 56\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n#3 Are these two words NOT the same?\n\"Gene\" != \"gene\"\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\nNotice that in logical queries, equal to is represented by == and not by = , which instead is used to assign a value to an object. However, in practice, most R programmers tend to avoid = since it can easily lead to confusion with ==.\n\n\n\nAssigning values to objects with &lt;-\nAssigning values to objects is another common task that we will perform. What can be an object ?\n\na list of names\na series of number\na dataset\na plot\na function\netc.\n\nIn short, an object can enclose different things which form part of your data analysis. For example, objects are useful to store results that you want to process further in later steps of the analysis. We have to use the assign operator &lt;- to assign a value to an object. Let‚Äôs have a look at an example:\n\n# Let's assign the gene \"TP53\" to the \"genes\" object\ngenes &lt;- \"TP53\"\n\nNow the object genes carries the value \"TP53\". If you check out the Environment pane, you should see that the gene object appeared there. We can also print values of an object in the console by simply typing the name of the object genes and hit Return ‚Üµ.\n\n# What are my genes?\ngenes\n\n[1] \"TP53\"\n\n\nTo create objects with multiple values, we can use the function c() which stands for ‚Äòconcatenate‚Äô:\n\n# Adding some more genes to the object\ngenes &lt;- c(\"TP53\",\n           \"TNF\",\n           \"EGFR\",\n           \"VEGFA\",\n           \"APOE\",\n           \"IL6\")\n           \n# Here are my genes\ngenes\n\n[1] \"TP53\"  \"TNF\"   \"EGFR\"  \"VEGFA\" \"APOE\"  \"IL6\"  \n\n\nTo concatenate values into a single object, we need to use a comma , to separate each value. Otherwise, R will report an error back.\n\n\ngenes &lt;- c(\"TP53\" \"TNF\")\n\nError: &lt;text&gt;:1:19: unexpected string constant\n1: genes &lt;- c(\"TP53\" \"TNF\"\n                      ^\n\n\n\nDon‚Äôt worry about it! R‚Äôs error messages tend to be very useful and give meaningful clues to what went wrong. In this case, we can see that something ‚Äòunexpected‚Äô happened and it shows where our mistake is."

This is because genes is not a character value, but an object. When we refer to objects, we do not need quotation marks.\n\nLooking at the list item in the environment page, you can see that the object data is classified as a List of 3, and if you click on the blue icon, you can inspect the different objects inside.\n\n\n\n\nFunctions\nWe mention the term ‚Äòfunction‚Äô multiple times, but what are functions and why we need them? In simple terms, functions are objects that contain lines of codes and can be seen as shortcuts for our programming. They are useful to save space and time and to make our code more readable and reliable. We will make an example to understand better, by calculating the arithmetic mean:\n\n# We create an object that stores our values\nvalues &lt;- c(1, 5, 7, 4, 13, 2, 9, 5)\n\n# Manually compute the sum \nsum &lt;- 1 + 5 + 7 + 4 + 13 + 2 + 9 + 5\n\n# Divide the sum by the number of values\nmean &lt;- sum / 8\nmean\n\n[1] 5.75\n\n\nOr‚Ä¶\n\n# Use the mean function that is part of the R base package\nmean(values)\n\n[1] 5.75\n\n\n\n# Let's check that the two methods coincide\nsum / 8 == mean(values)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\nData frames\nThe last type of objects we will see (of course there are far many more types‚Ä¶) is the data.frame, one of the most abundantly used in R. Think of data.frames as the R equivalent of Excel spreadsheets, so a way to store tabular data. As we will see later, pretty much all the data we are going to handle will be in the form of a data.frame or some of its other variations.\n\n# Let's create and display a data frame (a table) with four rows and two columns\ndata.frame(\"Class\"=c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\"), # First column\n            \"Quantity\"=c(1,10,4,6)) # Second column\n\n  Class Quantity\n1     a        1\n2     b       10\n3     c        4\n4     d        6\n\n\nWe have instructed R to create a data.frame object. We will give more of these commands from now on!"

    "text": "The basics of ChIP-seq data processing\n\nRaw Sequencing Output\nThe raw output of any sequencing run consists of a series of sequences (called tags or reads). These sequences can have varying length based on the run parameters set on the sequencing platform. Nevertheless, they are made available for humans to read under a standardized file format known as FASTQ. This is the universally accepted format used to encode sequences after sequencing. An example of real FASTQ file with only two reads is provided below.\n\n@Seq1\nAGTCAGTTAAGCTGGTCCGTAGCTCTGAGGCTGACGAGTCGAGCTCGTACG\n+\nBBBEGGGGEGGGFGFGGEFGFGFGGFGGGGGGFGFGFGGGFGFGFGFGFG\n@Seq2\nTGCTAAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGC\n+\nEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\n\nFASTQ files are an intermediate file in the analysis and are used to assess quality metrics for any given sequence. The quality of each base call is encoded in the line after the + following the standard Phred score system.\n\nüí° Since we now have an initial metric for each sequence, it is mandatory to conduct some standard quality control evaluation of our sequences to eventually spot technical defects in the sequencing run early on in the analysis.\n\n\n\nQuality metrics inspection\nComputational tools like FastQC aid with the visual inspection of per-sample quality metrics from NGS experiments. Some of the QC metrics of interest to consider include the ones listed below, on the left are optimal metric profiles while on the right are sub-optimal ones:\n\nPer-base Sequence Quality  This uses box plots to highlight the per-base quality along all reads in the sequencing experiment, we can notice a physiological drop in quality towards the end part of the read.\n\n\nPer-sequence Quality Scores  Here we are plotting the distribution of Phred scores across all identified sequences, we can see that the high quality experiment (left) has a peak at higher Phred scores values (34-38).\n\n\nPer-base Sequence Content  Here we check the sequence (read) base content, in a normal scenario we do not expect any dramatic variation across the full length of the read since we should see a quasi-balanced distribution of bases.\n\n\nPer-sequence GC Content  GC-content refers to the degree at which guanosine and cytosine are present within a sequence, in NGS experiments which also include PCR amplification this aspect is crucial to check since GC-poor sequences may be enriched due to their easier amplification bias. In a normal random library we would expect this to have a bell-shaped distribution such as the one on the left.\n\n\nSequence Duplication Levels  This plot shows the degree of sequence duplication levels. In a normal library (left) we expect to have low levels of duplication which can be a positive indicator of high sequencing coverage.\n\n\nAdapter Content  In NGS experiments we use adapters to create a library. Sometimes these can get sequenced accidentally and end up being part of a read. This phenomenon can be spotted here and corrected using a computational approach called adapter trimming.\n\nThe read trimming step consists of removing a variable portion of read extremities that contain adapters/have suboptimal quality indicated by the Phred score. Tools like Cutadapt can be used to perform this task after read QC, and FASTQC can be eventually run just after read trimming to double-check positive effect of getting rid of bad sequences. Note that after this step, reads might have different lengths.\n\n\nRead alignment\nNow that we have assessed the quality of the sequencing data, we are ready to align the reads to the reference genome in order to map the exact chromosomal location they derive from.\n\nA reference genome is a set of nucleic acid sequences assembled as a representative example of a species‚Äô genetic material. It does not accurately represent the set of genes of any single organism, but a mosaic of different nucleic acid sequences from each individual. For each model organism, several possible reference genomes may be available (e.g.¬†hg19 and hg38 for human).\nAs the cost of DNA sequencing falls, and new full genome sequencing technologies emerge, more genome sequences continue to be generated. New alignments are built and the reference genomes improved (fewer gaps, fixed misrepresentations in the sequence, etc). The different reference genomes correspond to the different released versions (called ‚Äúbuilds‚Äù).\n\nA mapper tool takes as input a reference genome and a set of reads. Its aim is to match each read sequence with the reference genome sequence, allowing mismatches, indels and clipping of some short fragments on the two ends of the reads.\n\nIllustration of the mapping process \n\nAmong the different mappers, Bowtie2 is a fast and open-source aligner particularly good at aligning sequencing reads of about 50 up to 1,000s of bases to relatively long genomes. By default, it performs a global end-to-end read alignment and by changing the settings, it also supports the local alignment mode. You can understand the difference by looking at this scheme:\n\n\n\nBowtie2 can identify reads that are:\n\nuniquely mapped: read pairs aligned exactly 1 time\nmulti-mapped: reads pairs aligned more than 1 time\nunmapped: read pairs non concordantly aligned or not aligned at all\n\n\nMulti-mapped reads can happen because of repetition in the reference genome (e.g.¬†multiple copies of a gene), particularly when reads are small. It is difficult to decide where these sequences come from and therefore most of the pipelines ignore them.\n\n\nMapping statistics\nChecking the mapping statistics is an important step to perform before to continue any analyses. There are several potential sources for errors in mapping, including (but not limited to):\n\nPCR artifacts: PCR errors will show as mismatches in the alignment\nsequencing errors\nerror of the mapping algorithm due to repetitive regions or other low-complexity regions.\n\nA low percentage of uniquely mapped reads is often due to (i) either excessive amplification in the PCR step, (ii) inadequate read length, or (iii) problems with the sequencing platform.\n\n70% or higher is considered a good percentage of uniquely mapped reads over all the reads, whereas 50% or lower is concerning. The percentages are not consistent across different organisms, thus the rule can be flexible!\n\nBut where the read mappings are stored?\n\n\nThe BAM file format\nA BAM (Binary Alignment Map) file is a compressed binary file storing the read sequences, whether they have been aligned to a reference sequence (e.g., a chromosome), and if so, the position on the reference sequence at which they have been aligned.\nA BAM file (or a SAM file, the non-compressed version) consists of:\n\nA header section (the lines starting with @) containing metadata, particularly the chromosome names and lengths (lines starting with the @SQ symbol)\nAn alignment section consisting of a table with 11 mandatory fields, as well as a variable number of optional fields.\n\n\nBAM file format \n\nQuestions:\n\n\nWhich information do you find in a BAM file that you also find in the FASTQ file?\n# Sequences and quality information\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the additional information compared to the FASTQ file?\n# Mapping information, Location of the read on the chromosome, Mapping quality, etc\n\n\n\n\n\nPeak calling\nThe read count data generated by ChIP-seq is massive. In order to predict the actual sites where the protein of interest is likely to bind, different peak calling methods have been developed. Peaks are regions with significant number of mapped reads that produce a pileup.\n\nChIP-seq is most often performed with single-end reads, and ChIP fragments are sequenced from their 5‚Äô ends only. This creates two distinct peaks of read density! One on each strand with the binding site falling in the middle of these peaks. The distance from the middle of the peaks to the binding site is often referred to as the ‚Äúshift‚Äù.\n\n\n\nForward (blue) and reverse (maroon) Read Density Profiles derived from the read data contribute to the Combined Density Profile (orange). Nat. Methods,2008\n\nThe most popular tool to find peaks is MACS2 which empirically models the shift size of ChIP-Seq reads, and uses it to improve the spatial resolution of predicted binding sites. Briefly, these are the steps performed by MACS:\n\nremoving duplicate reads\nmodelling the shift size\nscaling the libraries with respect to their controls\nperforming peak detection\nestimating False Discovery Rate (FDR)\n\nThe peak detection identifies areas in the genome that have been enriched with mapped reads.\n\nEnrichment = Immunoprecipitation reads/background reads (mock IP or untagged IP).\nIf an experimental control data is NOT available, a random genomic background is assumed.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of the Peak Calling step\n\n\n\nFinally, peaks are filtered to reduce false positives and ranked according to relative strength or statistical significance.\n\nDifferent peak profiles\nAn important factor that influences the sequencing depth that is required for a ChIP‚Äìseq experiment is whether the protein (or chromatin modification) is a point-source factor, a broad-source factor or a mixed-source factor.\n\nPoint sources occur at specific locations in the genome. This class includes sequence-specific transcription factors as well as some highly localized chromatin marks, for example, those associated with enhancers and transcription start sites. They will generate more often narrow peaks.\nBroad sources are generally those that cover extended areas of the genome, such as many chromatin marks (for example, histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) marks). They will give raise to broad peaks.\nMixed-source factors, such as RNA polymerase II, yield both types of peaks. As expected, broad-source and mixed-source factors require a greater number of reads than point-source factors. Peaks generated will have a mixed profile between narrow and broad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional QC metrics\nAfter peak calling, it‚Äôs important to check some metrics that are indicative of the overall quality of the ChIP-seq experiment. Here are two of the most useful:\n\nFRiP score: reports the percentage of reads overlapping within called peak. Can be useful to understand how much the IP sample is ‚Äúenriched‚Äù.\nStrand cross-correlation: high-quality ChIP-seq produces significant clustering of enriched reads at locations bound by the protein of interest, that present as a bimodal density profile on the forward and reverse strands (peaks). The cross-correlation metric calculates how many bases to shift the bimodal peaks in order to get the maximum correlation between the two read clusters, which corresponds to the predominant fragment length.\n\n\n\nBigWig and BED file formats\nMost high-throughput data can be viewed as a continuous score over the bases of the genome. In case of RNA-seq or ChIP-seq experiments, the data can be represented as read coverage values per genomic base position.\nThis sort of data can be stored as a generic text file or can have special formats such as Wig (stands for wiggle) from UCSC, or the bigWig format, which is an indexed binary format of the wig files.\n\nThe bigWig format is great for data that covers a large fraction of the genome with varying and continuous scores, because the file is much smaller than regular text files that have the same information and it can be queried more easily since it is indexed. Most of the ENCODE project data can be downloaded in bigWig format!\n\nIf we want to know instead the peak locations in the genome as chromosome coordinates with well defined start and end positions, we want to look at BED files, that are the main output of the peak calling step.\nA typical BED file is a text file format used to store genomic regions as coordinates. The data are presented in form of columns separated by tabs. This is the structure of a standard BED file, which can have also additional columns.\n\n\n\n\nWe will use this file type to inspect peak locations and for future downstream analyses!\n\n\n\n\nCollapse data into a single dataset\nImagine that you are performing these steps of read processing not just for one library, but for a collection of samples with different replicates and experimental conditions, and you subsequently want to make differential comparisons across conditions. To this aim, it‚Äôs necessary to collapse the single peak files obtained from each single library into a single consensus peakset.\nIn this step you can also add a filtering to exclude genomic intervals that are identified as peaks only in a minority of samples. DiffBind and BEDTools are two common programs that can handle this task.\nIt can be helpful to make a plot of how many peaks overlap in how many samples, like this one:\n\n\nThis plot shows that there are almost 4000 total merged peaks, representing the union of all intervals. At the other extreme, there are around 100 peaks that overlap in all 11 samples, representing the intersection of all the samples.\n\n\nWhich should we chose? Given the rigor of the statistical analysis that we are going to perform, now we can choose a more inclusive consensus set. The default is to make a consensus peakset using peaks identified in at least 2 samples.\n\n\n\nCounting reads in consensus peaks\nOnce consensus genomic regions are defined, the next step is to count the number of sequencing reads that align to these regions. This read counting process provides quantitative information about the strength and extent of protein binding within the identified peaks.\n\nUniquely mapped reads can be counted within peaks in the consensus using a tool called FeatureCounts.\n\nSample counts for all the consensus peaks are output as a tabular file, in which each row represents one peak, and you have one column for each sample. We will now load one and take a closer look: this will be our starting point in the hands-on analysis of a ChIP-seq dataset.\n\nBefore going on, let‚Äôs summarize the steps of a ChIP-seq analysis workflow that we have seen so far with the following scheme. You can find the file format names associated to the output of each task."

We generated organoid lines to model colorectal tumors, analyzed their epigenome, and compared it to the ATAC-seq-derived chromatin activity data of multiple other malignancies. We found a small number of enhancer sequences were conserved across all these types, and identified a transcription factor that linked them - the YAP/TAZ pair - that when perturbed would cause the death of malignant, but not normal, organoids, therefore representing a potential pan-cancer therapeutic target.\n\n\nIn this workshop, we will re-analyze a portion of the ChIP-seq dataset used in the paper, pertaining to Histone 3 Lysine 27 Acetylation - a marker of activation present at active regulatory sequences, enhancers and promoters alike."
